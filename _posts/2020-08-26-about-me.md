A page describing some more about myself. Enjoy!

## Things I Enjoy

  + Abbreviated list of "favorite" bands:
    1. Led Zeppelin
    2. The Beatles
    3. Parliament/Funkadelic
+ **Food/Cooking**
  + I love trying new cuisines and different types of food as well as cooking various dishes.
  Most recently was a West African Peanut Soup.
+ **Movies**
  + [**Hereditary**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/) is an absolute favorite to give an idea of my tastes.
+ **Programming**
  + Since I began I haven't been able to stop learning. Once I could do one thing the excitemnt pushed me further along.
